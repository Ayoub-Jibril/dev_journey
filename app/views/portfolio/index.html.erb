  <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Ayoub! </h1>
<p >
 Iâ€™m a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University with a passion for building clean, functional, and meaningful software.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-4">ðŸ’¡ Why I Chose Engineering</h2>
<p>
  Since I was young, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed solving problems â€” whether it was fixing things around the house or figuring out how things work. Engineering lets me do that every day. I chose computer engineering specifically because it combines logical thinking with creativity, and gives me the power to build tools that can help real people.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-4">ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Working On</h2>
<p>
As an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to bridge classroom theory with real-world engineering challenges. Iâ€™ve been developing practical skills through hands-on projects across areas like circuit design, embedded systems, automation, and software development. My goal is to apply both analytical and creative problem-solving in building efficient, impactful technologies.</p>
<p>
  My goal is to gain hands-on experience in engineering roles that challenge me to think critically, work collaboratively, and contribute to building impactful technologies â€” whether in software, hardware, or systems-level design.
</p>


<h2 class="mt-4">ðŸŽ¨ Hobbies & Interests</h2>
<p>
  Outside of academics and engineering, I enjoy staying active and creative. My hobbies include painting, swimming, running, going to the gym, and building personal tech projects in my spare time. I believe a balance of technical work and personal passion keeps me grounded and motivated.
</p>


<h2 class="mt-4">ðŸš€ Goals</h2>
<p>
My current goal is to land a co-op or internship in the engineering field, where I can grow through hands-on experience, contribute to impactful real-world projects, and collaborate with skilled teams across hardware or software domains.
